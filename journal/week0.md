# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I was able to install AWS CLI directly on Gitpod by following instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

### Create a budget 
I created a budget alarm for $1 to keep cost down as I was learning how to do stuff. 
I do have a second budget setup but will be deleted soon for concerns of two budget limit on the free tier
